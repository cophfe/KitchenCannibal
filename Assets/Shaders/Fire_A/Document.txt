Create new material from the shader (Fire_A) and edit settings on the material.

- Input image into "MainTexture" field (The more detailed the better)
- Distortion (Scale_B_Distortion) gives ripple effect
- Dissolve (Power_Dissolve) turns white into black (black = transparent)
^ Negative values will increae white = increase HDR intensity (So fully opaque whites will glow more with bloom)
- Time (Time_Speed) is what direction the the effects travel (-Y = Up)
