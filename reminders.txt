FOR EVERYONE USING THE UNITY PROJECT
----------------------------------------------
Try to minimise file size, it is a limited resource and large files (or many small files) will slow down unity.
For example, do not download hundreds of music tracks and put them all in the assets folder just to use one or two in the final game.
Files more than 100mB cannot be pushed to github, so be careful of that as well.
----------------------------------------------
Clone the repository in a folder that isn't far from the root drive, and make sure not to make file names unnecessarily long (for the same reason).
----------------------------------------------
Try to avoid modifying assets that other people are working on. This will cause merge conflicts, especially with binary files. 
If you need to change an asset you know someone is working on, please either ask them to change it themselves, or wait until they are done with the file.
----------------------------------------------
It is best to compartmentalise files for organisation. For example, the 'Materials' folder can have sub folders like 'Player' and 'Grunt'
----------------------------------------------
gameobjects can also be compartmentalised. For example, all lighting could be a child of a 'Lighting' empty gameobject.
----------------------------------------------
Many Unity Editor errors can be fixed by restarting unity. If the error persists, sometimes resetting the layout to default also helps.
----------------------------------------------
Use prefabs when creating gameobjects that are either being used across multiple scenes or will have multiple instances. 
This means people working on other scenes can use your work, with it updating automatically when you change the prefab.
DO NOT apply overrides to other people's prefabs!

SETUP EXTERNAL TOOLS FOR BUILDING TO ANDROID:
ONLY FOR BUILDING FOR THE QUEST 2
if this doesn't work notify connor or declan
Scroll to android and change the paths to these specified paths:
JDK:
C:\Program Files\AndroidBuildTools\OpenJDK
SDK:
C:\Program Files\AndroidBuildTools\SDK
NDK:
C:\Program Files\AndroidBuildTools\NDK
Gradle:
C:\Program Files\AndroidBuildTools\Tools\gradle

now you should be able to build to android
----------------------------------------------
Assets folders have been organised for efficiency purposes
Here is the use case for all folders:

-'_Scenes' contains all scenes, and is split up into personal scenes and levels. 
    Each person should use there own scene for testing and no one should modify each others scenes.
    Levels should be modified exclusively by a designer that is assigned to it. If someone else wants to modify a level they need to talk first with said designer.

-'Animation' contains animation clips and animator controllers.

-'Audio' contains mixers, sound effect and music files.

-'Editor' contains custom editor scripts

-'Third Party' is for third party plugins/packages. It is possible that moving third party assets from their default folder to this folder will cause errors, so keep that in mind.

-'Settings' contains global settings, like post processing, renderers, and URP assets. Post processing for individual scenes should probably be put in the scene directory, in a 'scenename' subdirectory

These are all self explanitory:
-'Materials' contains materials
-'Models' contain 3d models
-'Prefabs' contains prefabs
-'Scripts' contain scripts
-'Textures' contain textures
-'Sprites contain sprites
-'Shaders' contain custom shaders and shader graphs

----------------------------------------------
Many of Unity's files are temporary and can be deleted
Here are the necessary folders that need to be in a unity project directory for it to function properly: 
    Assets
    Packages
    ProjectSettings
    UserSettings
Others files are regenerated when opening unity. Remember that deleting the autogenerated files will lengthen load times significantly.
----------------------------------------------
Do not put anything in folders other than the assets folder.
